# Project 2: Breakout

Screen resolution: 16x9

My mechanic intervention is changing the direction of the ball if hits
the sides of the bat, this way the player have more control over the ball and
not just blocking it from falling while the ball move by his own mechanics
which the player cant control

GDD mechanics I changed/replaced/removed:
- changed the bat mechanics to move without drag and a fixed velocity.
- i changed the ball mechanics to move in a different direction wen hitting the
bat close to the sides (with bat colliders).
